# latent-space-covid-twitter-elites
Data and code for reproducing the analysis in the paper "Exploring the latent social space of COVID-19 Twitter elites".

The file model_fitting.R contains the code to directly reproduce the latent space modeling of the network of COVID-19 twitter elites as performed in the paper, using the (already preprocessed and cleaned) network data contained in the file network_edgelist.csv.

All code and instructions to arrive at the network starting from the original dataset*, as described in the paper, is contained in the data_processing folder.

*The full, original dataset, provided by [Banda et al.](https://www.mdpi.com/2673-3986/2/3/24), is available on Zenodo, at: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3723939
